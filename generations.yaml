    description: "The first-generation Nissan Kicks was introduced as a global subcompact crossover, initially for emerging markets before expanding to North America in 2018 as an indirect replacement for the quirky Juke. Built on Nissan's V-platform shared with the Versa, it featured a more conventional crossover design than the Juke with a practical focus on interior space, efficiency, and value. The exterior design incorporated Nissan's V-motion grille, floating roof aesthetic, and available two-tone color schemes. Power came from a naturally aspirated 1.6L four-cylinder engine producing 122 horsepower (North American specification), paired exclusively with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and front-wheel drive—notably, all-wheel drive was not offered. The interior emphasized practicality with surprisingly spacious seating for its compact dimensions, straightforward controls, and respectable cargo capacity. Standard and available features included a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, Bose Personal Plus audio system with headrest speakers, and Nissan Safety Shield 360 driver assistance technology. The Kicks established itself as a value-oriented entry point to the rapidly growing subcompact crossover segment, offering crossover styling and a higher seating position than a traditional hatchback, but with more emphasis on efficiency and affordability than off-road capability or performance."

    description: "The refreshed Nissan Kicks received a significant update focusing on styling and technology while maintaining the same fundamental platform and powertrain. Exterior changes incorporated Nissan's latest design language with a larger, more prominent V-motion grille identical to the Kicks e-Power variant, redesigned LED headlights and taillights, a more substantial rear bumper, and new wheel designs. The interior saw technology upgrades including a standard 7-inch touchscreen (8-inch on higher trims) with improved functionality, a new electronic parking brake, redesigned center console, and enhanced connectivity options including standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto across all trims. New available features included a Wi-Fi hotspot, wireless charging pad, and expanded USB ports. The powertrain continued unchanged with the 1.6L four-cylinder (122 hp) and CVT, maintaining its focus on efficiency rather than performance, still exclusively with front-wheel drive. Safety technology expanded with Nissan Safety Shield 360 becoming standard across all trim levels, including automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, rear automatic braking, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, and high beam assist. The updated Kicks went on sale in North America in February 2021 and in the Middle East in July 2021."

    description: "The second-generation Nissan Kicks debuted in the U.S. on 22 March 2024 for the 2025 model year, representing a complete redesign on Nissan's CMF-B HS platform. The new model is 1.7 inches longer, 3.5 inches wider and 0.6 inches taller, with approximately 2.3 inches longer wheelbase compared to its predecessor. The U.S. market model is powered by a larger 2.0-liter four-cylinder petrol engine producing 141 horsepower, which is 19 more horsepower than the previous 1.6L engine. An Xtronic branded CVT is the only available transmission choice in the US market, but for the first time outside of Japan, the Kicks is also available with optional all-wheel drive. The interior features twin 7-inch screens that serve as the gauge cluster and infotainment system, which can be optionally upgraded to 12.3-inch screens with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support. An available 10-speaker Bose sound system features speakers integrated into the front passenger seats' headrests. A front wireless charging pad is optional along with up to four USB type-C ports. Cloth seating is standard with optional heated front seats, while higher trims receive leatherette seating surfaces featuring Nissan's Zero Gravity design. The 2025 model year Kicks was awarded 'Top Safety Pick' by IIHS, equipped with Nissan Safety Shield 360 as standard across all trims. Production is handled at Nissan's plant in Aguascalientes, Mexico."
